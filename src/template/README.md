# Resource Template
This is a template that may be used to initialize a new resource. Copy and paste this folder and edit as needed.

## Conventions
Resources are organized in a series of folders:
- `client/` - Files inteded for client-side use.
- `server/` - Files intended for server-side use.
- `shared/` - Files intended for both client and server-side use (i.e. for shared configuration).
- `web/` - HTML/CSS/JS files for client-side UI using the FiveM embedded Chrome browser.

We often use the [Model-View-Controller pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) as a framework for organizing the message passing that occurs between the server and multiple clients. The "view" is handled client-side by the contents of `web/`, but you'll commonly find subdirectories for `controllers/` and `models/` on both client and server. Examine some of the existing resources in the repository for working examples.

You'll want to check out the [common resource](https://github.com/openmailbox/tsrp-fivem/tree/main/src/common) for global definitions widely used across all other resources.

The contents of `web/` include a skeleton [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) app which will be built automatically when the server loads the resource. Feel free to strip out some or all of the setup if Vue is overkill for your resource.

We typically use [Spectre CSS](https://picturepan2.github.io/spectre/) to maintain a common look and feel.
